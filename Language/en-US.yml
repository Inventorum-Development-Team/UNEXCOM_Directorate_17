  STR_CRYPTID_MIGRATION_PATTERNS: "Cryptid Migration Patterns"
  STR_CRYPTID_MIGRATION_PATTERNS_UFOPEDIA: "The Chuchunya, Wawkalak, and Alkonost cryptid species are all impossible creatures that should not exist according to our current zoological paradigm, and with no reproductive organs, thier origins remain a mystery. We theorize they were somehow artificially created by the extraterrestrial visitors for an as of yet unknown purpose. While the crossbreeds appear to be acclimated to extremely cold climates, they do not originate within our borders. From thier migration patterns, we believe they have originated from a location in the European Alps. While it would be impractical to run a search in such a large environment inside foreign territory, it is a crucial lead for our investigation, Comrade Commissar."
  STR_THIN_MAN_ANALYSIS: "Thin Man Analysis"
  STR_THIN_MAN_ANALYSIS_UFOPEDIA: "The Thin Man at first glance appears to be a nondescript Caucasian male, albiet sickly gaunt and of above average height. However, closer inspection reveals more...alien features. The creature sports abnormalities such as eerily reptilian eyes (concealed by sunglasses) and spotted marks along the neck similar to scales. As demonstrated in the field, the Thin Man was highly intelligent, equipped with extremly advanced weaponry, and as unprofessional as it sounds, capable of exerting some kind of telepathic control over our officers. Given previous examples of the genetic engineering prowess of the aliens, we theorize this creature is some kind of deliberate attempt to integrate or perhaps even infiltrate human societies."

  STR_OPERATION_GLADIO_BRIEFING: "Operation Gladio Briefing"
  STR_OPERATION_GLADIO_BRIEFING_UFOPEDIA: "Our officers managed to recover the Station Chief of the Budapest safehouse, codenamed Orlan, who briefed us about the identity of the attackers. This 'Operation Gladio' is a paramilitary organization created to support insurgency efforts in the theoretical contingency of a Soviet-occupied Western Europe. This 'stay-behind' group, structured after the French and Polish partisans (an unfortunate comparison), has several clandestine 'sleeper' agents and secret stockpiles of weaponry provided to them by thier Western backers. While the organization is designed to support NATO, it is entirely independent of thier command structure. We cannot jump to conclusions too hastily; it is entirely possible Gladio's actions in Budapest weren't officially sanctioned. Though when it comes to deniable operations, the line becomes blurry."
  STR_PROJECT_HAUNEBU_BRIEFING: "Project Haunebu Briefing"
  STR_PROJECT_HAUNEBU_BRIEFING_UFOPEDIA: "The 1st Directorate has just uncovered more information about the targets we neutralized in Berlin. All three of the scientists we managed to catch were associated with 'Project Haunebu,' a secret Nazi weapons program intent on chasing the dream of an unstoppable 'Wunderwaffe.' While it obviously did not produce sufficient results, surviving records indicate that German leadership placed an unusual level of confidence in the project. It seems that thier retrieval by Gladio was not invoulintary; rather, it was a planned defection. When Station Chief Orlan began catching on to the plot, Gladio attacked the safehouse in Budapest to cover thier tracks. We still have no answer if the attack or smuggling operation were approved by any Western countries or if this was a rogue operation. While we have managed to eliminate three of them, two are still out there. We obviously cannot allow them to fall into enemy hands. Good hunting, Comrade Commissar."
  STR_GLADIO_ORIGINS_BRIEFING: "Gladio Origins Briefing"
  STR_GLADIO_ORIGINS_BRIEFING_UFOPEDIA: "After we interrogated the MI6 liaison and preformed an analysis on the 'Thin Man,' we have come to several shocking conclusions about the history of Operation Gladio. It is apparent we are not the first to discover the aliens; in 1933 a crashed UFO was discovered by the Italians, promting the creation of the Gabinetto Ricerca Speciali, or 'RS33.' When Hitler found out, he twisted Mussolini's arm into providing some of the alien technology for thier own Wunderwaffen program, 'Project Haunebu.' However, in the following decade Italy and Germany would be pushed to the brink. On the backfoot from both sides for well over a year, in 1944 a small enclave of Italian Facists reached out and managed to successfully make diplomatic contact with the aliens. The details from there are sketchy, but the small enclave would begin slowly amassing power under the guise of Operation Gladio in secret. It appears MI6 and the CIA were just as blind about Budapest. With so many questions still unanswered, we need to bring in the last Haunebu scientist. Alive."
  STR_HAUNEBU_ORIGINS_BRIEFING: "Haunebu Origins Briefing"
  STR_HAUNEBU_ORIGINS_BRIEFING_UFOPEDIA: "It took some...coercion, but we have finally managed to make the Haunebu scientist talk. It appears that Project Haunebu was not the only secret Nazi program incorporating alien technology, but rather one of two. Project Haunebu experimented with anti-gravity and free energy suspension technology to design an advanced delivery system capable of launching a payload designed by a second project, 'Die Glocke' or 'The Bell,' to high earth orbit. While he did not know much else about Die Glocke, he did list the names of several researchers who worked on the project. All of whom have been inducted into our own Space Program. Considering the alien infiltrators were willing to risk exposure in an open firefight to secure a single Haunebu scientist, we must find and secure the Die Glocke researchers fast before it is too late."
