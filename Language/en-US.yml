  DYATLOV_PASS_INCIDENT_EVENT_DESCRIPTION: "A party of nine hikers from the Ural Polytechnical Institute dissapeared two months ago, and only now has the search party uncovered all nine bodies buried in the snow. Evidence seems to indicate they exhibited erratic behavior such as paradoxically undressing in the middle of a snowstorm. Three of them died from blunt injuries from some kind of animal, not hypothermia. All the more, locals in the area sighted orange lights in the sky. It is very likely that this incident is related to the Cryptids or the aliens, or perhaps both."

  LUMUMBA_CAPTURED_EVENT_DESCRIPTION: "Prime Minister Lumumba has been apprehended by forces loyal to his former chief-of-staff Joseph Mobutu near the Sankuru River despite attempted intervention by UN peacekeepers. We have reason to believe that Mobutu's forces were supported by the Belgian military and the CIA to counter our influence in Central Africa. We can only hope multi-way proxy conflict designated the 'Congo Crisis,' is not the template of modern warfare..."

  STR_CHUCHUNYA_ANALYSIS_UFOPEDIA: "Although invasive to the Russian wilderness, at first glance the subject appears merely be a mountain gorilla. Upon further examination, the brain of the creature is abnormally large, suggesting a high level of intelligence. It also lacks any sex organs, meaning it thankfully cannot reproduce naturally, but also brings up more questions as to thier origins. We believe this creature to be artificial in nature, the product of some bizarre alien science. Judging by the pattern of sightings, they appear to make long migrations in a straight path from a specific point. Perhaps we can utilize this information..."

There is no rational scientific origin of this apex preadator known to modern biology. It also lacks any sex organs, meaning it thankfully cannot reproduce naturally, but also brings up more questions as to thier origins.

While it is unable to take flight due to its weight, the Alkonost is still extremely agile and extremely lethal. It also lacks any sex organs, meaning it thankfully cannot reproduce naturally, but also brings up more questions as to thier origins. We believe this creature to be artificial in nature, the product of some bizarre alien science.

  STR_CRYPTID_MIGRATION_PATTERNS: "Cryptid Migration Patterns"
  STR_CRYPTID_MIGRATION_PATTERNS_UFOPEDIA: "The Chuchunya, Wawkalak, and Alkonost cryptid species are all impossible creatures that should not exist according to our current zoological paradigm, and with no reproductive organs, thier origins remain a mystery. We theorize they were somehow artificially created by the extraterrestrial visitors for an as of yet unknown purpose. While the crossbreeds appear to be acclimated to extremely cold climates, they do not originate within our borders. From thier migration patterns, we believe they have originated from a location in the European Alps. While it would be impractical to run a search in such a large environment inside foreign territory, it is a crucial lead for our investigation, Comrade Commissar."
  STR_THIN_MAN_ANALYSIS: "Thin Man Analysis"
  STR_THIN_MAN_ANALYSIS_UFOPEDIA: "The Thin Man at first glance appears to be a nondescript Caucasian male, albiet sickly gaunt and of above average height. However, closer inspection reveals more...alien features. The creature sports abnormalities such as eerily reptilian eyes (concealed by sunglasses) and spotted marks along the neck similar to scales. As demonstrated in the field, the Thin Man was highly intelligent, equipped with extremly advanced weaponry, and as unprofessional as it sounds, capable of exerting some kind of telepathic control over our officers. Given previous examples of the genetic engineering prowess of the aliens, we theorize this creature is some kind of deliberate attempt to integrate or perhaps even infiltrate human societies."
  STR_REPTOID_ANALYSIS: "Reptoid Analysis"
  STR_REPTOID_ANALYSIS_UFOPEDIA: "Despite very closely resembling various indigenous Earth reptiles, the origin of the moniker 'Reptoid,' the Reptoid is not a derivative creature such as the Cryptids or Thin Men. Its bizzare biology appears to be almost entirely alien, but we can gleam some understanding from thier deceased carcasses. The Reptoids have a large and very dense brain, enabling a high degree of intelligence, perhaps one surpassing our own, demonstrated by thier operation of advanced weaponry and exotic scientific equipment. They are very strong and high durable, proving to be very lethal combatants. These Reptoid aliens are never to be underestimated in the field."

  STR_OPERATION_GLADIO_BRIEFING: "Operation Gladio Briefing"
  STR_OPERATION_GLADIO_BRIEFING_UFOPEDIA: "Our officers managed to recover the Station Chief of the Budapest safehouse, codenamed Orlan, who briefed us about the identity of the attackers. This 'Operation Gladio' is a paramilitary organization created to support insurgency efforts in the theoretical contingency of a Soviet-occupied Western Europe. This 'stay-behind' group, structured after the French and Polish partisans (an unfortunate comparison), has several clandestine 'sleeper' agents and secret stockpiles of weaponry provided to them by thier Western backers. While the organization is designed to support NATO, it is entirely independent of thier command structure. We cannot jump to conclusions too hastily; it is entirely possible Gladio's actions in Budapest weren't officially sanctioned. Though when it comes to deniable operations, the line becomes blurry."
  STR_PROJECT_HAUNEBU_BRIEFING: "Project Haunebu Briefing"
  STR_PROJECT_HAUNEBU_BRIEFING_UFOPEDIA: "The 1st Directorate has just uncovered more information about the targets we neutralized in Berlin. All three of the scientists we managed to catch were associated with 'Project Haunebu,' a secret Nazi weapons program intent on chasing the dream of an unstoppable 'Wunderwaffe.' While it obviously did not produce sufficient results, surviving records indicate that German leadership placed an unusual level of confidence in the project. It seems that thier retrieval by Gladio was not invoulintary; rather, it was a planned defection. When Station Chief Orlan began catching on to the plot, Gladio attacked the safehouse in Budapest to cover thier tracks. We still have no answer if the attack or smuggling operation were approved by any Western countries or if this was a rogue operation. While we have managed to eliminate three of them, two are still out there. We obviously cannot allow them to fall into enemy hands. Good hunting, Comrade Commissar."
  STR_GLADIO_ORIGINS_BRIEFING: "Gladio Origins Briefing"
  STR_GLADIO_ORIGINS_BRIEFING_UFOPEDIA: "After we interrogated the MI6 liaison and preformed an analysis on the 'Thin Man,' we have come to several shocking conclusions about the history of Operation Gladio. It is apparent we are not the first to discover the aliens; in 1933 a crashed Saucer was discovered by the Italians, promting the creation of the Gabinetto Ricerca Speciali, or 'RS33.' When Hitler found out, he twisted Mussolini's arm into providing some of the alien technology for thier own Wunderwaffen program, 'Project Haunebu.' However, in the following decade Italy and Germany would be pushed to the brink. On the backfoot from both sides for well over a year, in 1944 a small enclave of Italian Facists reached out and managed to successfully make diplomatic contact with the aliens. The details from there are sketchy, but the small enclave would begin slowly amassing power under the guise of Operation Gladio in secret. It appears MI6 and the CIA were just as blind about Budapest. With so many questions still unanswered, we need to bring in the last Haunebu scientist. Alive."
  STR_HAUNEBU_ORIGINS_BRIEFING: "Haunebu Origins Briefing"
  STR_HAUNEBU_ORIGINS_BRIEFING_UFOPEDIA: "It took some...coercion, but we have finally managed to make the Haunebu scientist talk. It appears that Project Haunebu was not the only secret Nazi program incorporating alien technology, but rather one of two. Project Haunebu experimented with anti-gravity and free energy suspension technology to design an advanced delivery system capable of launching a payload designed by a second project, 'Die Glocke' or 'The Bell,' to high earth orbit. While he did not know much else about Die Glocke, he did list the names of several researchers who worked on the project. All of whom have been inducted into our own Space Program. Considering the alien infiltrators were willing to risk exposure in an open firefight to secure a single Haunebu scientist, we must find and secure the Die Glocke researchers fast before it is too late."
  STR_CRYPTID_ORIGINS_BRIEFING: "Cryptid Origins Briefing"
  STR_CRYPTID_ORIGINS_BRIEFING_UFOPEDIA: "After securing the Alien Base in the Tyrol region, Cryptid sightings have drastically reduced in number. Its vicinity to the Gladio HQ is no coincidence, especially considering recent revelations about Project Haunebu. The alien process to create the Cryptids is completely divorced from our own reproductive paradigm. Instead, they utilize advanced machinery to artifically print a Cryptid fetus and nurture it in a vat of nutrient-dense fluid of unknown composition. The process is capable of creating a fully-grown Cryptid in only a few weeks time. It appears that the Reptoid aliens were, for lack of a better term, engineering and manufacturing genetic hybrids (Cryptid and Thin Men) for some time now. We theorize the Cryptids were intended as shock troops, thier sheer durability and resemblance to horror folklore is certainly an intentional decision to instill terror. This would imply the aliens have an understanding of our culture enough to weaponize it which, if true, is disturbing."
  STR_DIE_GLOCKE_ORIGINS_BRIEFING: "Die Glocke Origins Briefing"
  STR_DIE_GLOCKE_ORIGINS_BRIEFING_UFOPEDIA: "Shockingly, the live Reptoid we recovered from the Manchurian Saucer was able to speak Russian as well as several other human languages. We managed to goad it into revealing much albiet through a lengthy, condecending diatribe, before we were forced to execute it. Combined with the intelligence from Kasputin Yar, the sinister plan of the aliens has been uncovered. The Reptoids are not even the masterminds, they are merely servants of a greater interstellar power as the Cryptids are to them. They seek to conquer Earth as thier own and have infiltrated our societies for decades, only temporarily halted by the Great Patriotic War. It appears that Die Glocke is actually an advanced communications buoy capable of relaying a message to a massive Saucer fleet in deep space. Station Chief Orlan has been reassigned to Berlin to study the Saucer Rescue Beacon recovered during Operation KIKIMORA. Assuming both communications devices operate on the same principles, understanding the Rescue Beacon could help us find Die Glocke. We must plan our next move carefully, and execute it swiftly."
  STR_BUREAU_11_BRIEFING: "CIA Bureau 11 Briefing"
  STR_BUREAU_11_BRIEFING_UFOPEDIA: "The documents we have recovered from the crashed American spyplane have confirmed our longheld suspicions: the US government is aware of the aliens. A clandestine sub-unit of the Central Intelligence Agency known as 'Bureau 11' has been tasked with dealing with the aliens since at least the 1950s. For how long and to what extent, we do not know. Considering the extent of Gladio and Haunebu infiltration within our own space program, we cannot rule out alien involvement in this 'Bureau 11' either. It is imperative we find out more as soon as possible and thankfully we have a lead. A specific place was referenced multiple times throughout the documents. We believe this to be a CIA safehouse related to Bureau 11. It is located in a major city in the United States, but we cannot decipher further without people on the ground. We should construct a Hideout in North America as soon as possible. Be careful, for all intents and purposes it is enemy territory. Our research and development division has begun designing prototypes for concealable weapons we could smuggle into the US for our deniable operations."
